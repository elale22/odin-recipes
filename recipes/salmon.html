    <h1>Chef John's Fresh Salmon Cakes</h1>
    <img src="../img3.jpg" alt="Imagen de la torta de salmon terminada">
    <h2><i>"Perfect as-is, though I'd season heavier...or a great base to experiment with"</i></h2>
    <p>Salmon cakes are one of my go-to emergency meals. Every once in a while I like to use fresh salmon. <br>
        Salmon is one of those products, like chicken, that's very easy to get into a rut with. <br>
        People generally find a few recipes that work for them, and just stay with those, but this fairly simple
        preparation should be easy to add to anyone's rotation. <br>
        Serve with lemon wedge and remoulade sauce. You can use any bread crumbs instead of panko breadcrumbs, if
        desired.</p>
    <h3>Ingredientes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>

        <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons minced red bell pepper</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons minced celery</li>

        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon capers</li>

        <li>1 ¼ pounds fresh wild salmon, coarsely chopped</li>

        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>

        <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>1 pinch seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon panko bread crumbs, or to taste</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat extra virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, red pepper, <br>
            celery, and a pinch of salt in hot oil until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. <br>
            Add capers; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Stir salmon, onion mixture, mayonnaise, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, garlic, mustard, cayenne, <br>
            seafood seasoning, salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl until well-mixed. <br>
            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firmed and chilled, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Form salmon mixture into four 1-inch thick patties; sprinkle remaining panko bread crumbs over each patty.
        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-heat. <br>
            Cook patties in hot oil until golden and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
